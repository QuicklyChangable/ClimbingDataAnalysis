# ClimbingDataAnalysis

I'm going to begin this project by taking a look at the data involving the IFSC Climbing Competion results 1990 - 2019. This ca be found here on Kaggle:

The data includes information regarding participants, their age, and their results. The data is also split by gender and Adult/Youth divisions.

I would be interested to discover how age and gender impacts results.

Does the likelyhood of someone making it to finals increase, if they have previously done so?

What countries are most likely to have competitors in the top 3?
